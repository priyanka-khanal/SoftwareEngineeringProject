      <h1>General Introduction</h1>
      <h5 class="display-4">For this portion of your grade you will be randomly assigned the profile of a fictional person from on of the four periods we will cover in the course (Heretics and Kings, 1500-1700; Enlightenment and Revolution, 1700-1815; the long Nineteenth Century, 1815-1918; the Violent Twentieth Century, 1918-Present).

      Your assignment will be to use this profile to construct a character, their life events, and fate. Rather than being a pure work of imagination, you must craft a life story for your character based on primary and secondary sources. You will be graded on your use of sources, the plausibility of your character's life story, and creativity.<br><br>
        ***Circumstances of history are often ugly, violent, and unequal but we must treat our characters, (even though fictional) with dignity; understanding that they stand for real linces, many fo which were cut short as a result of circumstance, war, accident, intolerance, racism, and brutality.
        As you create (and end) imaginative lives, you must be conscious to not make light of their circumstances or perpetuate sterotypes and caricatures which helped justify inequalities and violence in the first place. In the end, these stereotypes tell us less about the transgression of this principle will be dealt with forcefully. If you have a question about what constitutes appropriate -ask!

      <h4>Purpose and Description:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <h5 class="display-4">The purpose of the “Identifying Possible Life Events” portion of the avatar project is to give you a general sense of the different historical events that shaped the period in which your character lived and which might have influenced their life and/or decisions.  This information is critical as it will enable you to make an informed decision about when to begin and end your character’s life, as well give you a number of different events about which you can look up primary and secondary sources.</h5>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Tips:</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>
          <h5 class="display-4">One way to begin this process is to read our textbook chapters that correspond to your character’s timeline.  For instance, if your character is alive in the 16th century (1500s), you could begin by looking through chapters 12, 13, and 14.  As you read, look for events that are mentioned as specifically happening in your country, as well as those that happened somewhere else, but might have also influenced your character’s life (keep in mind that you would need to be able to justify this effect with evidence from sources you find).  Some of the chapters in the textbook have more of a thematic rather than a strictly chronological organization.  Therefore you should also take a look at chapters that do not have a specific set of dates in their title.  For instance, Chapter 16, “The New Science of the Seventeenth Century,” also has information pertinent to the 1500s. </h5>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h5 class="display-4">Another possibility is to go to the NWMSU’s library’s homepage and search “A history of ___________”.  This will bring up a large number of results that you can further refine.  If you are only interested in books that our library owns is to click on the “Books & Movies” tab.</h5>
