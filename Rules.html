                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      The character you create must utilize the parameters of the avatar outlined on the slip of paper that you randomly drew during the first week of class.
                      <ol>
                        <li>Interpreting the information on your avatar assignment slip:

                                      a.	The course content has been divided into four general periods: Heretics and Kings, 1500-1700; Enlightenment and Revolution, 1700-1815; the Long Nineteenth Century, 1815-1918; the Violent Twentieth Century, 1918-Present.  The “Period” column denotes the era in which your avatar was alive, as well as giving you a sense of when your avatar assignments will officially begin and end – i.e. the more recent the period, the later in the semester your project will be due.
                                  </li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li>This set of years is situated somewhere within a larger “Period”.  The significant historical events that you select for your avatar to interact with must fall within this window of years.</li>
                                    <li>Only the background and/or fate part of the assignment are exempt from the requirements of the previous clause.  You are allowed to situate the birth or death of your avatar either prior or after the “Timeframe” dates.  Your reason for doing so should be made apparent in either the background and/or fate entry.</li>
                                  </ol>

                                  <li>This entry is refers to the geographic location in which your avatar was born.  Your character is free to move about Europe (and even the world) or stay put, so long as the migration is consistent with evidence from your sources.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <ol>This entry indicates whether your avata is male or female.</ol>

                              <li>"Class/Occupation"
                                <ol>This entry identifies the social class and/or the occupation of your avatar.  It has purposefully been kept vague in order to allow you greater latitude to create your character.  Your avatar might be born into a particular class, but that does not mean they will end their lives in that same class!</ol>
                              </li>
                              <li>"Additional Information"
                                <ol>This category only appears for certain avatars and consists of additional information with which you must construct your character.</ol>

                    </li>
                    <li>Another set of variables that will influence the life of your avatar are their ability scores that will be randomly determined by a roll of a 12 sided die. These scores must be recorded on your avatar’s coversheet and must always be brought to your meetings with Dr. Scofield.
                      <ol>
                        <li>Interpreting the meaning of the ability scores:
                          <ol>
                            <li>"Strength"
                              <ol>
                                  <li>This ability score refers to your avatar’s physical power.  Higher rolled numbers reflect greater strength, lower rolled numbers reflect greater weakness.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>"Attitude towards Authority"
                              <ol>
                                <li>This ability score refers to how your avatar feels about people and institutions with greater power and influence than him or her in society.  Higher rolled numbers reflect greater respect towards authority, lower rolled numbers reflect greater indifference and/or hostility.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>"Piety"
                              <ol>
                                <li>This ability score refers to the religious beliefs/commitments of your avatar.  Higher rolled numbers reflect greater devotion to their respective religion, lower rolled numbers reflect greater indifference and/or hostility.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>"Patriotism"
                              <ol>
                                <li>This ability score refers to your avatar’s devotion and/or love of their kingdom and/or country.  Higher rolled numbers reflect greater devotion to the political unit in which they live, lower rolled numbers reflect greater indifference and/or hostility.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>"intelligence"
                              <ol>
                                <li>This ability score refers to your avatar’s ability to reason and acquire and apply knowledge and skills.  Higher rolled numbers reflect greater intelligence, lesser rolled numbers reflect lower abilities.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>"loyalty"
                              <ol>
                                <li>This ability score refers to your avatar’s commitment to the people and/or institutions around them and/or promises they make.  Higher rolled numbers reflect greater devotion to causes to which the avatar commits and makes it more unlikely that they will change sides, lower rolled numbers reflect lesser commitment and makes it more likely that the avatar will change sides if a more attractive opportunity presents itself.</li>
                              </ol>
                            </li>
                          </ol>

              </li>
              <li>
                <h2>Creating Your Life:</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>Your character’s background and subsequent life actions must be consistent with the parameters of the avatar provided at the beginning of the assignment.  This includes developing the character according to the basic features that were on the slip of paper that you randomly drew AND the different ability scores that you rolled in your first meeting with Dr. Scofield.</li>
                  <li>Your character must interact with one historical event over the course of their lifetime.  See the assignment description for more details.</li>
                  <li>Your character’s end must be feasible considering the time period and their background.*  See the assignment description for more details.
                    <ul><li>*Circumstances of history are often ugly, violent, and unequal, but we must treat our characters, (even though fictional) with dignity; understanding that they stand for real lives, many of which were cut short as a result of circumstance, war, accident, intolerance, racism, and brutality.  As you create (and end) imaginative lives, you must be conscious to not make light of their circumstances or perpetuate stereotypes and caricatures which helped justify inequalities and violence in the first place.  In the end, these stereotypes tell us less about the people who were the objects than the people who made and perpetuate them!  Any transgression of this principle will be dealt with forcefully.  If you have a question about what constitutes appropriate – ask!</li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>There is no requirement regarding the lifespan of your character, but they must live long enough to produce children.  Conversely, you should also take into account contemporary life expectancies.  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Your Character's Movement:
                <ol><li>Your character is free to move about Europe (and even the world), so long as the migration is consistent with evidence from your sources.  However, at the end of their life, you avatar must either have returned to Europe or have a connection to descendants who continue to reside in Europe.</li></ol>
              </li>
              <li>Changing Your Character:
                <ol><li>You have the opportunity for one character exchange should you be dissatisfied with the avatar you have selected.  However, the selection of your second avatar will also be random and final.  The exchange must happen within the first week after avatars being assigned.</li></ol>
              </li>
              <li>Selecting Appropriate Sources:
                <ol><li>Imagination and creativity are essential elements of the avatar project, but each stage of your avatar’s life (background, decisions, and fate) must be based on primary and secondary sources (see below for corresponding definitions).</li></ol>
              </li>
              <li>The role of the Game Master (Dr. Scofield):
                <ol><li>I may take up the role of a non-player character (such as Louis XIV or Kaiser Wilhelm II) and intervene in your story or force your avatar to experience a particular event.  Should that happen, you will be expected to adapt your character’s narrative accordingly.</li></ol>
              </li>
              <li>Plagiarism:
                <ol><li>NEVER, EVER, EVER use the work of another and claim it as your own.  This is plagiarism and is an infraction against the University’s Code of Academic Integrity (<a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Academic-Integrity.pdf">Link here</a>).  Any infractions (no matter how small) will be dealt with forcefully and potentially lead to a zero on the entire assignment and the course as a whole.  I am more than happy to help you if you need assistance – just ask!</li></ol>
              </li>
              <li>Potential Extra Credit:
                <ol>
                  <li>Adding additional links to primary sources not already identified by me that provide meaningful additional resources for your classmates. (+2-5 points depending on the quality and originality of the source)</li>
                  <li>Creating a feasible and significant interaction between your avatar and one of your classmates (+2-5 points depending on the feasibility, quality, and creativity of the interaction).</li>
                  <li>As an added incentive, you and the peers from your time period will vote on the Timeline that best exemplifies the goals of the project. The winner will receive extra credit and the group will have the chance for more if it bests the selection from other groups.  You can keep revising the Timeline up until the time of the vote at the end of the semester.  Help your group win!</li>
                </ol>
